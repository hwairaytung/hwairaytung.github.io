## Bio

I am currently a postdoc at the University of Utah math department working mostly with Sean Lawley in mathematical biology. I received my PhD (2023) from the Duke University math department under the guidance of my advisor, Rick Durrett. My work focuses mostly on using stochastic processes to understand biological phenomena across a variety of fields, including oncology, ecology, epidemiology, and pharmacology. I will also be on the job market fall 2025.
