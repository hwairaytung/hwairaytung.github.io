## Bio

I am about to start a postdoc at the University of Utah math department working in mathematical biology. I just received my PhD (2023) from the Duke University math department, where I worked with my advisor, Rick Durrett. My work focuses on using stochastic processes and dynamical systems to understand biological phenomena across a variety of fields, including oncology, ecology, and epidemiology.
