## Bio

I am a postdoc at the University of Utah math department working with Sean Lawley and Fred Adler in mathematical biology. I received my PhD (2023) from the Duke University math department under the guidance of my advisor, Rick Durrett. My work focuses mostly on using stochastic processes to understand biological phenomena across a variety of fields, including oncology, ecology, epidemiology, and pharmacology. 

I am seeking a tenure track position for fall 2026.
